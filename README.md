# WebUI

My attempt at understanding webpack and wiring together Webpack + ReactJS + SASS. 
I've crafted this by hand to understand how it all hangs together.

## Development

```bash

# I've install make, node and nvm via home brew:
nvm use v8.2.1

# I've installed yarn@0.27.5 on my system and the Makefile requires this:

# Set up all dependancies projects dependancies:
make install

# Run the dev server
make run_local

```
