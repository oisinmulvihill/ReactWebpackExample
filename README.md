# React Webpack Example

My attempt at understanding Webpack and wiring together Webpack + ReactJS + SASS. I've crafted this by hand to understand how it all hangs together.

## Development

```bash

# I've install make and nvm via home brew:
nvm use --delete-prefix v10.11.0

npm install yarn

# Set up all dependancies projects dependancies:
make install

# Run the dev server and develop in browser:
make run

# Build into static files for release:
make build

```
